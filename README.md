# Movie Project

This React.js project showcases a compact movie name list featuring custom movie cards displaying titles, genres, and countries. The application, built with simplicity in mind, employs dummy data within the code instead of complex APIs. Serving as a foundational exploration of React.js, the project also integrates the capabilities of react-router-dom for seamless navigation.

### This template now includes instructions for installing Node.js, along with a verification step to ensure that Node.js and npm have been installed successfully on the user's system.
  - Install Node.js:
    This step helps the user ensure that they have the latest version of Node.js (a JavaScript runtime) installed on their computer. Node.js is required to run JavaScript outside of the web browser, and it's necessary for running React.js applications.

  - Verify the Installation:
     After installing Node.js, the template suggests running two commands (node -v and npm -v) in the terminal to verify that Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) were installed correctly. These commands check the versions of Node.js and npm installed on the user's system.
